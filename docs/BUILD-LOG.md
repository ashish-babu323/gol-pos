# Gol POS — Build Log

Built during the Meta Global AI Developer Hackathon, October 26 – November 4, 2026.
One entry per day; the git history carries the same dates.

## Day 1 — Mon Oct 26, 2026
- Project created from scratch after the hackathon kickoff confirmed the demo may
  show only work built during the event.
- Frame committed by Muse (manager/operator): product spec, data model, JSON
  store, register API (catalog / sale / summary / pending), the Gol brain core
  (item resolution, price query, staged price change, add-to-cart, day summary;
  writes execute only on the confirm word "gol"), register web skeleton with the
  full-screen Gol chat drawer, fictional "Sunrise Mart" demo catalog (24 SKUs).
- Build split: Dev — register UI polish and owner view; Grok — catalog expansion
  to ~60 SKUs + test battery; Muse — brain and QA gates.
- Gates: Wed Oct 28 register core end-to-end · Fri Oct 30 brain battery (>=90%)
  · Sun Nov 1 full demo run x3 + public-repo check · Mon Nov 2 freeze and film ·
  submit Nov 2–3 · deadline Wed Nov 4, 9:00 PM ET.
- **Gol AI POS — built with Muse (Meta Model API).** The submission story,
  owner-locked Oct 26: "MR.STORE was already a platform. Then Muse arrived —
  and with Muse's APIs, we built Gol: the brain that runs it by chat."
- Brain provider rewired so the code tells the same story: the brain shipped
  this morning as a deterministic intent engine with no model behind it. Now
  **muse-spark-1.3 via the Meta Model API is the PRIMARY composer** of Gol's
  replies — price answers, the day-summary line, and free-form turns are
  written by Muse from the shop's live facts, and accepted only when the
  reply carries the exact figure it was given (grounding check). The
  deterministic engine remains as the silent fallback and still owns item
  resolution, staged cards and the "gol" confirm — writes never depend on
  the API, and the register rings even if the API is down. The key stays
  server-side (env var, or an env file outside the web root holding a
  META_MODEL_API_KEY line); every brain response carries a `meta` marker
  (`provider: meta-model-api | deterministic`, `model`) outside the UI.
- Live proof on the dev preview (Oct 26 evening, one test sale of
  2× Coca-Cola rung and then rolled back): "How much is a Coke?" →
  "A Coca-Cola 20oz costs $2.19." · "What is todays total?" → "Today's total
  is $4.73 across 1 sales — cash $4.73, card $0.00." · "Coke ko mulya kati?"
  → "Coca-Cola 20oz ko mulya $2.19 ho." (language law holds through the Muse
  composer). All three responses: `meta.provider = meta-model-api`,
  `model = muse-spark-1.3`. Live data restored afterwards: catalog.live is
  byte-identical to the seed, Coke back at $2.19, no pending card, no test
  sale left behind.
- **The full Muse family inside Gol AI POS — Spark thinks fast, Wonder
  thinks deep, SAM sees, Muse Image creates** (owner order, Oct 26 evening).
  One server-side client (`server/meta.php`) now serves all four models off
  the same protected key; `resolve_item()` moved to `store.php` so every
  lane shares the resolver. The lanes:
  - **Wonder (muse-wonder-1.0) — deep think.** Judgment questions (why /
    how was / week / suggest / kina / kasto…) route to a new analysis
    branch: the deterministic layer assembles the week's facts (per-day
    totals, week aggregate, tender split, top sellers) and Wonder composes
    the judgment under the same figure-grounding check; Spark composes if
    Wonder is unreachable, the template speaks if neither answers.
    Register-speed turns stay on Spark.
  - **SAM 3.1 — the eyes.** New `server/photo.php` + a 📷 button in the
    chat: the owner uploads a product/shelf photo with an optional concept
    hint; SAM segments it via the Responses API and the read stages as a
    `photo_read` card (photo, concept, region count, boxes) — candidates
    for the owner to confirm, never silent truth. On "gol" a matched
    catalog item goes to the cart; an unmatched read is only logged. If
    SAM doesn't answer, the photo still stages with an honest no-read note.
  - **Muse Image (muse-image-1.0) — creates.** "Make an offer poster for
    Coke" resolves the item + catalog price, generates the poster, shows
    the preview in chat as a `poster` card, and publishes ONLY on "gol" —
    into the demo store's feed (`data/feed.json`, shown in the owner
    view). Fictional Sunrise Mart branding only.
  - Live proof on the dev preview (one small call per model; a fictional
    week of 40 sales / $235.27 seeded for the Wonder test, today
    deliberately quiet at $2.37, then removed): Wonder — "Why was today so
    slow? How was this week overall?" → composed analysis carrying the
    exact figures ($2.37 today · $235.27 week · top seller Pringles Sour
    Cream 2.5oz — $36.64) + one grounded suggestion, `meta.model =
    muse-wonder-1.0`. SAM — the generated poster uploaded back with prompt
    "bottle" → 1 region, box x1=430 y1=652 x2=719 y2=1514 in the 1152×2016
    frame, `meta.model = sam-3.1`; card confirmed with "gol" and logged,
    nothing auto-added (no catalog match for "bottle"). Muse Image —
    poster for Coca-Cola 20oz at the catalog $2.19, PNG 1152×2016 at
    `web/uploads/posters/poster-20261027-010029-2ee738.png`, `meta.model =
    muse-image-1.0`; confirmed with "gol" → the one entry now in the demo
    feed (kept as demo content). Regression: Spark price path re-verified
    after the refactor ("Coca-Cola 20oz costs $2.19.", `muse-spark-1.3`).
    Hygiene afterwards: seeded sales + photo log + test upload removed,
    catalog.live byte-identical to the seed, Coke $2.19, no pending card.
    Note: heavy scripted curl from the build machine trips the host's
    bot-check page after several calls — late checks were run over SSH
    loopback instead; real browsers are unaffected.
- **Gate-2 brain battery: 60/60** (late Oct 26). Grok's battery set
  (`docs/brain-battery.gate2.json`, six intents × EN / Romanized NP /
  Devanagari + the reply-language rule) scored 29/60 against the morning
  brain. The brain lane closed the five gaps in the deterministic layer —
  Devanagari intents (price-change verbs, चाहियो, Devanagari digits), a
  real new-item intent that stages cards (price asked, never invented),
  a close branch that writes the day record (`closes.json`, readable at
  `api.php?closes`), widened day-total phrasings, word-start alias
  matching — plus stem-based reply-language detection. Rerun against the
  live preview: baseline 30/60 → 59/60 → **60/60** on the final full run,
  with the Day-1 spot check (Coke $2.19 → staged 2.50 → "gol" executes)
  reproduced and all test state rolled back byte-for-byte. Full
  case-by-case results: `gate2-battery-results-2026-10-26.md` in the
  hackathon pack.
- **Receipt print settings — one store, two doors** (late Oct 26). Print
  settings moved out of any menu and into Gol's two doors: the chat (read
  on "print settings"; changes staged as old -> new cards, executed only on
  "gol") and the owner panel (an editable form over the SAME
  `data/settings.json` — `golpos_settings()`/`golpos_save_settings()` in
  store.php, `?settings` + POST in api.php). Settings: store name, address
  (+show), phone (+show), Gol ring logo, footer, copies 1-3, paper width
  58/80mm, tax line, auto-open receipt. The register renders every receipt
  from them (header/footer lines, copies with cut marks, width classes +
  named @page print rules, logo toggle, auto-open toast), and the receipt
  modal gained a Print button. The owner panel also gained the manual
  Reports card: Today / Yesterday / This week / date picker over the same
  day-summary data the chat speaks (`?report`), close records shown marked
  Closed, and a Close-the-day button running the chat's own close path
  behind a tap-confirm. Settings battery S1-S10 + manual-door M1-M3:
  **13/13** against the live preview; Gate-2 re-run after the build:
  58 clean passes + 2 host-503 cases re-verified by hand — no assertion
  failed, battery definition untouched. All test state restored
  byte-identical (catalog == seed, settings = defaults). Full results:
